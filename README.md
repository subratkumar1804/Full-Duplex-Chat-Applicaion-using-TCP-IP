# Full-Duplex-Chat-Applicaion-using-TCP-IP

<h4>REQUIREMENT:</h4>
There are two hosts, Client and Server. Both the Client and the Server exchange message
i.e. they send messages to and receive message from the other. There is a two way communication
between them.


<h4>OBJECTIVE:</h4>
To implement a full duplex application, where the Client establishes a connection with the
Server. The Client and Server can send as well as receive messages at the same time. Both the Client and
Server exchange messages.


<h4>DESCRIPTION:</h4>
In full-duplex operation, a connection between two devices is capable of sending data in both directions simultaneously. 
Full-duplex channels can be constructed either as a pair of simplex links (as described above) or using one channel designed to permit bidirectional simultaneous transmissions. 
A full-duplex link can only connect two devices, so many such links are required if multiple devices are to be connected together.
